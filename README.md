# minesweep-with-friends

This game is suposed to work like the windows minesweeper game but it will be possible to play cooperatively.

## Stories

A mountain story is a high level user story that is the highest level of abstraction. A boulder is a smaller piece of the system that is more managable. A subtask is a small task that is part of a boulder.

## Version

The versioning of this project will follow the amount of mountain stories that are completed followed by the amount of boulders that are completed and then the amount of subtask that are completed.
